This is an R Markdown document that provides the compiled code for the Course Project for Practical Machine Learning Course - Summer 2015. 


```{r}
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
library(doMC)
library(knitr)
library(xtable)
library(randomForest)
library(doSNOW)
library(data.table)
## Function: Download the input files provided in the Course
### pml-training.csv 
### pml-testing.csv 

download.data <- function() {
 download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv","pml-training.csv",method="curl")
 download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv","pml-testing.csv",method="curl")
}

### Function: Read the file and clean it up 
### 1. Change all "#DIV/0! to blanks

read.data <- function(file) {
 fread(file,na.strings=c("#DIV/0!",""))
}

### Read all files presented for the course
rawtrain <- read.data("~/Documents/RWorkingDirectory/Coursera-May2015/pml-training.csv")

### Set the seed so that the output is reproducible
set.seed(15)

### Get all the column names so we can use it subset it later on
names <- colnames(rawtrain)

## Functions: Identify columns that contain NA and marked them accordingly
nacolumns <- rawtrain[,sapply(.SD, function(x) any(is.na(x)))]

### Function: Eliminate some columns that would not be used for predictions
### First 7 columns would not be used for the predictions that may skew the result 
dropcolumns <- function(x){
  x[,!c("V1","user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1", "raw_timestamp_part_2", 
        "cvtd_timestamp", "new_window", "num_window"),with=F]
}

### Choose the training data with only the features that would be used for predictions
### Determine features for training the model
rawtrainfeatures <- dropcolumns(rawtrain[,eval(names(which(nacolumns == F))),with=F])

### Function: Transform Features on the rawtrainingfeatures dataset
transformfeatures <- function(x){
   x[,classe:=factor(classe)]
}


### Do some cross validation using the training set that was sanitize and with the columns not used for
### predictions removed using 60% of data from training as training set 
### Create training and test set from the rawtrainfeatures dataset 
### Threshold being used is 60%

intrain  <- createDataPartition(rawtrainfeatures$classe, p=.60, list=FALSE)
training <- rawtrainfeatures[intrain[,1]]
testing  <- rawtrainfeatures[-intrain[,1]]

### Create model based on RandomForest model to predict the classe variable 
### Use training data from the rawtrainfeatures dataset 
### Requires doSNOW package
### 
model.rf <- train(y=as.factor(training$classe), 
                  x=training[,!"classe",with=F], 
                  tuneGrid=data.frame(mtry=3), 
                  trControl=trainControl(method="none"), method="parRF") 

### Check for confusion matrix results 
confusionMatrix(predict(model.rf, newdata=transformfeatures(testing)), factor(testing$classe))
confusionMatrix(predict(model.rf, newdata=transformfeatures(testing)), factor(testing$classe))$overall["Kappa"]
print(varImp(model.rf, scale = FALSE))



### CourseWork - write a file with the answer set in working directory 
### Sample: "/Users/user1/Documents/RWorkingDirectory/Coursera-May2015"
### Files: "problem_id_#[1:length(x)]

##Function: Create the n files from running predictions using the testing file 
write.pml.predictions <- function(x){
        n = length(x)
        for(i in 1:n ) {
                filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
                write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)      
        }        
}
### Run the model using the testing file we initial received 
### Read the ORIGINAL testing file that we have set-aside 

validateTesting <- read.data("~/Documents/RWorkingDirectory/Coursera-May2015/pml-testing.csv")


### Pass the testing file to see how the model.rf predicts the column classe
### using an unseen set of data 
### Using the function presented in the course, it would write out the predicted value for "classe"
### and write the files with the convention 
### problem_id_## where ## is 1 to length of the testing file 
### Using the original testing set-aside earlier do the following:
### 1. use the nacolumns to cleanse the find out the non-NA 
### 2. use the dropcolumns to drop not-needed columns for predictions

write.pml.predictions(predict(model.rf, 
        newdata=dropcolumns(validateTesting[,eval(names(which(nacolumns == F))[-60]),with=F])))
```

Here are some of the plots analyzed to see the relationship of the variables to the classe variable

```{r, echo=FALSE}
qplot(total_accel_belt,colour=classe,data=training,geom="density")
qplot(total_accel_arm,colour=classe,data=training,geom="density")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
